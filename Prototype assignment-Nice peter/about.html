			<h2>Raveena</h2>
			<p>Hi guys, I’m Raveena – the owner of Just Cakes Bakeshop.

				It’s been a journey to get here, and one of my most important core values is transparency and openness.
				I have always wanted to conduct my business in a way that was genuine, passionate, and exuding love at
				every single step. So – I want to share a little bit about myself – so you get to know the story behind
				Just Cakes. Here goes.
				When I was sixteen, in high school, I felt isolated, insecure, and alone. Dark thoughts consumed my life
				for nearly two years. I didn’t feel worthy of being on this planet, truly. But then – I discovered
				baking. I had always loved working with my hands as a kid – my mother would often bring me and my
				sisters craft sets and other activities so we wouldn’t watch too much television. One day, she and my
				sister brought home a piping set. So, we made a cake – it was a boxed vanilla cake mix with chocolate
				filling, and I used a ziplock bag with the corner cut off as a piping bag to create a basketweave icing
				effect that I saw on Google. Needless to say, after that cake </p>
